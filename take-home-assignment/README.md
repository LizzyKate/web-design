# Take home assignment

Please spend no more than 2 hours on this! Our goal for the exercise is to gain 
a better understanding of your approach to open source web development and how 
you might work with the existing Tahoe-LAFS team. Here is the assignment:

1) Fork [https://github.com/tahoe-lafs/web-design](https://github.com/tahoe-lafs/web-design) 
and create a branch, adding your project in the `/take-home-assignment` directory
as a folder with CSS and HTML files. You should build your project in a stepwise 
manner (DO NOT ADD COMPLETED FILES) and open a PR when youâ€™re ready.

2) Create a static webpage that uses [https://sajith.github.io/tahoe-website/](https://sajith.github.io/tahoe-website/) 
as an example of the links and information we would like the example website to contain.
You may use any layout. The Tahoe-LAFS team happens to like the
   aesthetics at these sites, for example:
	   
	 -   [https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/](https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/)
	 -	  [https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
	 -	
		  [https://magit.vc/](https://magit.vc/)

3) Please make sure the website is accessible, maintainable and mobile-friendly. 
The code should be clear to understand, navigate and modify for an engineer with 
no web design experience.

NOTE: This assignment is NOT meant to be a redesign of our website! We understand 
the limitations of what can be created in 2 hours.

Let us know if you have any questions on the above! We ask that you submit your 
assignment no later than Sunday, April 11th.
